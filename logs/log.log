2023-05-19 11:36:43,308 - INFO - The returned answer is: Atrial fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia where the heart beats irregularly and often too fast. It is defined as "an irregular heart rhythm characterized by rapid and disorganized atrial electrical activity resulting in an irregular ventricular response" (ESC Guidelines, page 373). It is diagnosed through electrocardiogram (ECG) and symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Atrial fibrillation can lead to complications such as stroke and heart failure.
